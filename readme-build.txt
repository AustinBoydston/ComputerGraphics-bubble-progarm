Building the application Bubble Pop

1. Using a command prompt/line, move to the directory Build/ which contains all the files for this application.
2. Bubble Pop uses gradle so the next step is to simply generate all executables by using gradlew installDist which will create a build directory.
3. Follow the directory path of build/install/base/bin/ to find the executables.
4. Open the executable BubblePop.bat and it should open the application and run.
5. When finished, just close out the window and run gradlew clean in the Build/ directory to remove the build directory with executables and its files.
