After having built and opened the application, you can play the idle clicker game Bubble Pop. The options are simple and
easy to use.

1. When bubbles start spawning in the window, simply move your mouse over the bubbles and click within their area to pop them
and see an animation. This will increase your pop counter to the top left. This is the basic function of this application.

2. To toggle between colorful variety of bubbles or the vanilla cyan color, press the C key. This should cycle through the two
and the next spawn will generate the new toggle.
