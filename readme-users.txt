After having built and opened the application, you can play the idle clicker game Bubble Pop. The options are simple and
easy to use.

1. When bubbles start spawning in the window, simply move your mouse over the bubbles and click within their area to pop them
and see an animation. This will increase your pop counter to the top left. This is the basic function of this application. This
also works with mouse press so a quick click or a long press will trigger the pop.

2. To toggle between colorful variety of bubbles or the vanilla cyan color, press the C key. This should cycle through the two
and the next spawn will generate the new toggle. The toggle is also indicated in the top left corner of the screen, the second line
indicating whether the colorful bubbles are on or off.

3. Above the colorful line, there is another line indicating your current amount of points or pops by size. These are based on the
sizes of bubbles you have popped.

4. To exit the application, simply press the X on the right top hand side of the application window.
